# ðŸ“ŒHandwriting_Recognition_Image_Classification
Develop ML models for image classification, then convert those models into the TF-Lite file format, which can be embedded on Android and iOS.
This dataset consists of more than four hundred thousand handwritten names collected through charity projects.
